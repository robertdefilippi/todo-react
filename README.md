# To-Do App

This is a simple To-Do App bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can preform basic to-do functionality:

  - Add an item
  - Mark an item as done
  - Remove an item
  
This project was designed to illustrate an understanding of parent and child components, states, and bootstrap styling.
